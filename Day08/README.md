## Overview

### The challenge

- Create a Caesar Cipher: Encode/encrypt a message by shifting letters by a predetermined amount.
then decrypt it. 
(A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted forward or backward by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

Example (Shift by 3):
Plaintext: HELLO
Ciphertext: KHOOR (Each letter is shifted forward by 3)
Itâ€™s one of the oldest encryption methods, used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages. However, it's very easy to break using frequency analysis.)
